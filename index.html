									<h2><a href="https://github.com/AbhishekSharda/K_Means_Clustering_Customer_Segmentation">Customer Segementation (Machine Learning)<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, K-Means Clustering was utilized to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The customer transaction data was pre-processed and scaled, and the K-Means algorithm was applied to determine the optimal number of clusters. Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib were used for the analysis. The results were successful in segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, revealing key trends and patterns in the data. </p>

									<a href="https://github.com/AbhishekSharda/Logistic_Regression_Hotel_Reservation_Cancellation_with_In_Depth_EDA" class="image fit"><img src="images/hotel.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, the goal was to predict hotel reservation cancellations using logistic regression. The process involved conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features and relationships, cleaning and pre-processing the data, and applying a logistic regression model with hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search CV. The performance of the model was evaluated using cross-validation and a confusion matrix. Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were utilized for the analysis. The final model was able to accurately predict hotel reservation cancellations with 98% accuracy. </p>

									<a href="https://github.com/AbhishekSharda/EDA-of-US-accidents--2.8-million-records-" class="image fit"><img src="images/accident.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This project involved conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 2.8 million records of US accidents. Python was used to extract and clean the dataset, while statistical analyses and data visualization were conducted using Pandas and Matplotlib. Correlations and patterns were identified through feature engineering and hypothesis testing. The tools used included Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, and statistical techniques. The comprehensive EDA led to the discovery of important insights on the factors contributing to accidents, such as time of day, weather conditions, and road characteristics. These insights can be used to improve road safety measures and reduce the incidence of accidents..</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/AbhishekSharda/EDA_Airbnb_New-York_City/tree/main" class="image fit"><img src="images/airbnb.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, the Airbnb dataset for New York City was analyzed to gain insights on the behavior of its features and provide recommendations for Airbnb to enhance decision-making and profitability. The data was prepared and cleaned using Pandas, and in-depth exploratory analysis was performed using data visualization techniques. The insights obtained revealed the most popular boroughs for Airbnb listings, the average listing prices, and the most reviewed listings. The analysis can be used by Airbnb to optimize their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/AbhishekSharda/Project_Diabetes_Prediction" class="image fit"><img src="images/diab.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project analyzes diabetes data from the Pima Indian tribe, focusing on exploratory data analysis and model training to address important business questions. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains information about female patients at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage, including glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, BMI, and age. The goal is to gain insights into the various aspects of diabetes in the tribe and build a classification model to predict the onset of diabetes within five years of follow-up.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/AbhishekSharda/Tableau_Financial_Complaints_KPI_Dashborad" class="image fit"><img src="images/kpi.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Tableau Financial Complaints KPI Dashboard project involved creating a dashboard to visualize financial complaints data. The dataset used contained information about complaint ID, product type, sub-product type, issue, sub-issue, and more. The dashboard included features such as complaints by product and state, in progress and disputed rates, and complaints by media. The project showcases advanced data visualization skills in Tableau and offers valuable insights into financial complaints data for stakeholders to make informed decisions.</p>

									<p>In this project, AutoScraper library in Python was used to scrape data from Amazon.ca. The focus was on retrieving the price, title, and number of star ratings of a book titled "Data Analysis for Social Science: A Friendly and Practical Introduction". After providing the required data to the AutoScraper, it retrieved the information from the webpage. To test the scraper, a different URL for physics books was used, and the scraper was able to retrieve the price of all search results for physics books on Amazon.ca.</p>

									<p>This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease using several factors such as age, sex, chest pain type, and other medical parameters. The dataset contains 12 features, including the target variable - Heart Disease. The project involved collecting and preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis, feature selection and engineering, model selection and training, model evaluation using various metrics, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance. The goal was to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on individual characteristics.</p>

									<p>The analysis of the swine flu outbreak of 2009 suggests that population density played a significant role in the spread of the disease in the United States and Mexico. People aged 18-49 were the most affected, and there was a drop in pork consumption in both countries, possibly related to the outbreak. These factors were uncovered through analysis and provide valuable insights into the outbreak's contributing factors.</p>
